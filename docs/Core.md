This chapter deals with the construction of the core of the aircraft and will include the materials used as well as the construction of the wings and tail surfaces.

## Material
The core of the aircraft consists of
1. [XPS foam boards](https://www.amazon.de/Styrodurplatten-St%C3%A4rke-Breite-L%C3%A4nge-Modellbauplatten/dp/B08NXGNQH7/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=XPS-Platten&qid=1617616486&s=diy&sr=1-4),
2. Hot glue,
3. Wooden skewers,
4. [Aluminium bar](https://github.github.com/gfm/),
5. wire,
6. tape.

The core of the aircraft, i.e. the fuselage, wings, rudders and tail units, are largely made of [XPS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrol#Extrudiertes%20Polystyrol). This material should ensure sufficient stability. At the same time, the weight of the panels is very low. I used hot glue and standard wooden skewers to glue the cut elements together. However, care must be taken that the hot glue can melt the xps panels if the temperature is too high.


## Parts and Layout
The fuselage and the tail unit I have built almost only by feel. The shape of the wings, however, must be well planned, since they provide the lift and are therefore almost the most important part of the body shell.
