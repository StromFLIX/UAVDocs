This chapter deals with the construction of the core of the aircraft and will include the materials used as well as the construction of the wings and tail surfaces.

## Material
The core of the aircraft consists of
1. [XPS foam boards](https://www.amazon.de/Styrodurplatten-St%C3%A4rke-Breite-L%C3%A4nge-Modellbauplatten/dp/B08NXGNQH7/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=XPS-Platten&qid=1617616486&s=diy&sr=1-4),
2. [Hot glue](https://www.obi.de/kleber/pattex-heisskleber-hot-sticks-transparent-200-g-11-mm/p/1687359)
3. [Wooden skewers](https://www.amazon.de/Metaltex-570130-Schaschlikspie%C3%9Fe-100-st%C3%BCck/dp/B009V0P85C/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=schaschlikspie%C3%9Fe+holz&qid=1618144727&sr=8-5)
4. Aluminium bar (2cm x 2cm x 200cm)
5. wire
6. tape.

The core of the aircraft (fuselage, wings, rudders and tail), are made of [XPS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrol#Extrudiertes%20Polystyrol). 
This material is lightweight and ensures sufficient stability. In addition to the pure XPS, I laminated the outward-facing side with standard adhesive tape. 
This creates additional stability of the aircraft. After a few attempts to foil the already installed parts, I decided to foil the entire panels before I cut out the shapes.
It is easy to add the tape to a flat surface, than already shaped objects.
I used hot glue and standard wooden skewers to connect the cut elements together.
However, care must be taken that the hot glue can melt the xps panels if the temperature is too high. 
Lowering the temperature or turning of the hot glue gun helped me not burn the material.

## Parts and Layout
I built most of the parts only by feel. 
The shape of the wings must be well planned, as they provide lift and are therefore an important part of the body.

### Wings
I used [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_RzXO5u3M0) to build the wings.
I made the wings much wider because I want to add some weight later and keep the opportunity to carry multiple lipos.
My wings are 30cm wide and 100cm long each.
As described in the video, I split the foamboart into two parts. A 30 cm base plate and a roughly 40cm upper plate. 
The upper plate can be a little too large, since the rear part becomes the rudder, which you can shorten later as desired. 
After tapering the two edges of the foam that form the front edge, I trimmed the dotted lines and removed some material.
This creates a rounded shape when the wings are folded. 
The shape of the wing should be visible in the next picture. I have inserted a 2.5 cm wide XPS strut contrary to the Youtube video.
![WIng](/img/wing.jpg)
The connection between the fuselage and the wings was made by an aluminum rod that went almost through the entire length of the wings. 
Since the rod does not fill the entire height of the wings, I made holes in the wings from above with a small screwdriver and filled them with plenty of hot glue. 
> Be careful to hit the rod and not fill the wings with hot glue unnecessarily 
After about 5 holes per wing, the wings were fixed. Another layer of tape smoothed out any unevenness caused by the hot glue.

I simply cut the flaps diagonally on one side and taped them in place. 
To make the rudders moveable by servos, I cut a cable tie in two parts. 
About 2,5cm and 1,5cm. The longer piece I have provided at the upper end with a small hole for the control wire. 
I cut the rudder about 20cm from the fuselage in parallel, applied hot glue and glued the two pieces of cable tie in a triangle shape. 
About 15cm away from the wing I cut a 1x2,5 cm wide hole for the servo. 
As a connector, I simply took a wire and ran it through a small plastic tube so that force could be applied when the rudder was pushed.

### Fuselage
To build the fuselage, I cut out the three middle elements from XPS. Since my panels were only one meter long, I had to glue two panels together. 
I used hot glue and wooden sticks to connect the two elements.

On both sides of the fuselage I cut out a 2 cm square about 50 cm from the nose. 
This hole should later serve as an attachment for rod that connects the wings to the fuselage. 
At the first attempt it turns out that wood is not a good choice, because its elasticity is much too high. 
As soon as the airplane is pulled upward, the wings bend upward and offer the air a much larger attack surface. 
Instead of a smooth climb, the plane simply bounces up and down as you use the elevator.

A square aluminum rod solves this problem, but also weighs significantly more. In the following picture you can see the new aluminium rod and the old wooden connection. 
If would start over today i would not use any wooden rod for stabilization.

On the top of the fuselage I decided to use more flaps than less. 
Probably a lot of hardware still had to be installed: Navio2, RaspberryPi, receiver, Lipo, GPS, charge controller, FPV, etc.
 I simply cut the plates to fit, cut the flaps and connected them with tape on one side. On the other side, I simply used rubber bands and wooden sticks for fastening.

### Tail

I simply built the tail unit from two plates. One in the shape of a trapezoid and one in a triangle with the tip cut off.

The elevator works in the same way as the rudder.

The yaw I constructed with a wooden stick and loops of wire, so that I have a symmetrical construction.

I rounded off the edges that point in the direction of flight with a wooden stick and hot glue.



## Construction priciples 
I used a few techniques over and over again during the build, all of which are actually very simple, but turned out to be quite efficient. 

### Hot glue and wooden sticks as stabilizers 
As soon as the XPS panels are glued to the fuselage, for example, they already provide a high degree of stability. Transverse forces are compensated well due to the right-angled gluing of the panels. However, torsion is very poorly compensated. i formed an X out of the wooden rods and pierced them through the outer skin. With hot glue, both as a connection between the wood and the XPS, as well as the two rods themselves, the stability can be significantly increased.

I simply added such struts until sufficient stability was achieved. Everything, however, always according to feeling. Probably far fewer struts will suffice. 

### Laminating the xps panels
I originally started by installing the panels first and then foiling the resulting shape. However, it is much easier to glue the entire plate. Especially when building the wings, it is much easier to form the correct shape when the tape provides additional stability. (As long as you don't accidentally cut the tape).
