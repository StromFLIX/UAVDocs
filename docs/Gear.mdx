It was probably not such a smart idea to install a landing gear with wheels in advance, because where I live there are either only dirt roads on which you can neither land nor take off the plane and the roads are not wide enough or too short. 
Nevertheless, before I accidentally sink the plane on a nearby lake, I wanted to try to land the plane somewhere where it might not come directly to a 100% loss. 
Therefore, I ordered a landing gear on hobbyking, which is usually a spare part from a PNF aircraft and just built it under the duck.

## The front wheel
In other words: The one-time wheel. 
To keep the plane level, I had to build an extension between the fuselage and the wheel, which unfortunately is not really stable. In the beginning, the plane weighed only ~1kg, which meant that the landing gear still held to some extent, even during landings on grass. However, with all the installed equipment and reinforcements, it was no longer possible to land the aircraft without losing the entire landing gear.

I think I'll have to live with that until I'm sure it can land and take off autonomously.

## Water landing
I have not yet started to build a landing gear that can land on water, because I want to configure the autopilot perfectly beforehand and I also want to be sure that the solar supply of the battery works.
